abstract = {In this work, we consider a novel problem of maximizing monotone k-submodular functions under the individual knapsack constraint () over the ground set V, which has been found numerous applications in machine learning, including data summarization and information propagation. We propose an approximation algorithm that has approximation ratio and takes O(nklog (n)/ϵ) query complexity, where ϵ is an input parameter. Alongside theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on our proposed algorithm via some applications, such as Influence Maximization and Sensor Placement. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm gives competitive solution quality with state-of-the-art techniques but significantly reduces the required queries.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of k-submodular maximization under a knapsack constraint over the ground set of size n. This problem finds many applications in various fields, such as multi-topic propagation, multi-sensor placement, cooperative games, etc. However, existing algorithms for the studied problem face challenges in practice as the size of instances increases in practical applications. This paper introduces three deterministic and approximation algorithms for the problem that significantly improve both the approximation ratio and query complexity of existing practical algorithms. Our first algorithm, FA, returns an approximation ratio of 1/10 within O(nk) query complexity. The second one, IFA, improves the approximation ratio to 1/4−ϵ in O(nk/ϵ) queries. The last one IFA+ upgrades the approximation ratio to 1/3−ϵ in O(nklog(1/ϵ)/ϵ) query complexity, where ϵ is an accuracy parameter. Our algorithms are the first ones that provide constant approximation ratios within only O(nk) query complexity, and the novel idea to achieve results lies in two components. Firstly, we divide the ground set into two appropriate subsets to find the near-optimal solution over these ones with O(nk) queries. Secondly, we devise algorithmic frameworks that combine the solution of the first algorithm and the greedy threshold method to improve solution quality. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed ones with several experiments in some instances: Influence Maximization, Information Coverage Maximization, and Sensor Placement for the problem. The results confirm that our algorithms ensure theoretical quality as the cutting-edge techniques, including streaming and non-streaming algorithms, and also significantly reduce the number of queries.}

abstract = {Stimulated by practical applications arising from economics, viral marketing, and elections, this paper studies the problem of Groups Influence with Minimum cost (GIM), which aims to find a seed set with the smallest cost that can influence all target groups in a social network, where each user is assigned a cost and a score and a group of users is influenced if the total score of influenced users in the group is at least a certain threshold. As the group influence function, defined as the number of influenced groups or users, is neither submodular nor supermodular, theoretical bounds on the quality of solutions returned by the well-known greedy approach may not be guaranteed. In this work, two efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees for tackling the GIM problem, named Groups Influence Approximation (GIA) and Exact Groups Influence (EGI), are proposed. GIA is a bi-criteria polynomial-time approximation algorithm and EGI is an (almost) exact algorithm; both can return good approximate solutions with high probability. The novelty of our approach lies in two aspects. Firstly, a novel group reachable reverse sample concept is proposed to estimate the group influence function within an error bound. Secondly, a framework algorithmic is designed to find serial candidate solutions with checking theoretical guarantees at the same time. Besides theoretical results, extensive experiments conducted on real social networks show our algorithms’ performance. In particular, both EGI and GIA provide the solution quality several times better, while GIA is up to 800 times faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

abstract = {This paper studies the Diminishing Return Submodular Cover (DRSC) problem as follows: given a diminishing return submodular function f:Z+E↦R+ over the ground set E of size n, a positive integer B as the maximum value of a coordinate of a vector in Z+E and a threshold α>0, the problem asks to find the vector with the smallest size x so that f(x)≥α. This problem has been attracted by much research recently due to its importance in machine learning and combinatorial optimization. However, because of high query and adaptive complexities, the existing algorithms might still not be efficient enough when working with large input data. This paper proposes a randomized and bicriteria approximation algorithm that has O(log⁡n) adaptive complexity and O((n+log⁡nlog⁡B)log⁡(nB)) query complexity. Our algorithm significantly reduces both adaptive and query complexities compared to some state-of-the-art algorithms by factors of Ω(log⁡(m)log2⁡(mnlog⁡B)(1+log⁡(log⁡B)/log⁡(n))), Ω(min⁡{n/log⁡(n),log⁡(B)}) respectively, where m=f(B⋅1).}

Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithms are more effective than the state-of-the-art methods in the application of Influence Threshold with k topics.

Each has certain upper and lower bounds so that the influence spread is maximal. However, solving this problem faces two main challenges: it is an NP-hard problem, and the seed sets with strong influence may not satisfy the fairness constraint. To address this problem, we propose the Fairness Budget Influence Maximization algorithm. This algorithm combines an improved greedy strategy with generating sampling and a stop-and-stare technique. We conducted experiments on real social networks. The result shows that our proposed algorithm equalizes or outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of the objective value, the running time, the memory usage, and especially the target communities coverage ratio of the seed set. It is almost greater than the compared algorithm and guarantees fairness constraint.",

    abstract = { The field of Submodular Maximization subject to a Knapsack constraint has recently expanded to a variety of application domains, which is facing some challenges such as data explosions or additional conditions. There exist plenty of objective functions that cannot be evaluated exactly in many real cases unless they are estimated with errors. It leads to solving the problem under noise models. Somewhat surprisingly, Submodular Maximization subject to a Knapsack constraint under Noise models (SMKN) has never been discussed a lot before. Hence, in this paper, we consider the problem with two kinds of noise models which are addition and multiplication. Inspired by the traditional Greedy algorithm, we first propose a Greedy algorithm under Noises with provable theoretical bounds. In order to find the solution when input data are extremely large, we then devise an efficient streaming algorithm that scans only a single pass over the data and guarantees theoretical approximations. Finally, we conduct some experiments on Influence Maximization problem under knapsack constraint, an instance of SMKN to show the performances of the proposed algorithms. }
