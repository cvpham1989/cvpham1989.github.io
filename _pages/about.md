I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science and the Dean of the Faculty of Computer Science, as well as the head of the Operational Research and AI Laboratory (ORLab) at the School of Computing, Phenikaa University. My research centers on the design and theoretical analysis of scalable approximation algorithms for core optimization problems in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data summarization, and social network analysis. I also explore reinforcement learning techniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of learning systems.
