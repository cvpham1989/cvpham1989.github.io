I am a Lecturer and Researcher at ORLab, Faculty of Computer Science, Phenikaa University. My research interest focuses on design and analysis of scalable algorithms for ubiquitous combinatorial optimization problems arising in artificial intelligence, data summarization and social network analysis.
